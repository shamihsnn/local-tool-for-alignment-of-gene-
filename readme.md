## Features

- Interactive sequence input with real-time validation
- Configurable scoring parameters — match, mismatch, and gap penalties
- Dynamic scoring matrix visualization
- Instant alignment output with traceback highlighting
- Pure client-side — no server, no install, runs entirely in the browser

## Algorithm

The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs **local sequence alignment** — identifying the most similar region between two sequences rather than aligning them end-to-end. It guarantees an optimal local alignment by exhaustive dynamic programming.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Match score | Reward for identical residues |
| Mismatch penalty | Penalty for substitutions |
| Gap penalty | Penalty for insertions/deletions |

## Getting Started

No installation needed. Clone and open directly in a browser:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
open index.html
```

Or use a local server:

```bash
npx serve .
```
